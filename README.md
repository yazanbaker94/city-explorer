## Overview
I need to create a react web app that pulls or gets data from locationiq's API and retrieves it using Axios, and then I need to display the data based on the customer's needs, where he needs to fill a form with the city's name, in order for the web app to display different types of data about the city.

## Getting Started
The user must sign up on locationiq's website, create a personal token, download axiom package on react and include it via axion.get() function, and then display it using react's components.

## Architecture
The application uses react to build the web app and has a form in the main page, then the app uses axiom's library to pull data from locationiq's API.
